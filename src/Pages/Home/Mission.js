          Chirag is a non-governmental organization (NGO) whose purpose is to
          impart value- based education to economically weaker section of the
          society. Its various activities are spreaded in and around the
          lush-green campus of Nalanda college of Engineering Chandi. Chirag's
          philosophy stands on three pillars of Shiksha, Sanskar, and
          Swavalamban. We believe that education is not merely loading children
          with information. Therefore, we try our best to establish a connection
          of class-room teaching with daily-life activities and behaviors. With
          this point in mind, we keep organizing various activities that are
          aimed to further nurture these values.
